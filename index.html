    <h2>FUZZING'25</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>4th International Fuzzing Workshop (FUZZING) 2025</b> welcomes all researchers,
        scientists, engineers and practitioners to present their latest research findings,
        empirical analyses, techniques, and applications in the area of fuzzing and
        software testing for automated bug finding. This year, the workshop will feature
        multiple interleaved tracks.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller;"><b>New this Year #1</b> (Short papers). In addition to the infamous <a href="#registered">
	registered reports</a> (14 pages ACM single-column; "[TITLE] (Registered Report)"),
	we now also welcome a short papers track called <a href="#nuggets">Fuzzing Nuggets</a> 
	(8 pages; ACM single-column; "[TITLE] (Short Paper)"). A fuzzing nuggest is an 
	evidence-backed position papers on fuzzing research, or experience reports on 
	state-of-the-art fuzzing practices. The goal of this track is to serve as a platform
	for researchers and practitioners to share substantiated opinions or reflections that
	would be of interest to the larger fuzzing community, but which would not ordinarily
	be appropriate for a full-length research paper.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller;"><b>New this Year #2</b> (Artifact Evaluation). After two years at TOSEM, we will
	organize artifact evaluation at our workshop again for papers that have passed Stage 1
	and been marked as in-principle accepted. Stay tuned for more details.
    </p>
    <h3 id="registered">Main Track - Registered Reports for Research Papers</h3>
    <p>
        This track will be organized as <b>Stage 1</b> in a <b>2-stage preregistration-based
        publication process</b>. All research papers will be peer-reviewed on the basis of a
        full-length preregistered report, and acceptance will be based on (i) the
        significance and novelty of the hypotheses or techniques, and (ii) the soundness
        and reproducibility of the methodology specified to validate the claims or
        hypotheses -- but explicitly not based on the strength of the (preliminary) results.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: smaller;"><b>Rigorous design; preliminary results</b>.
        In this track, the workshop solicits registered reports drafts.
        Submitted report drafts are expected to be a full technical paper sans the
        full evaluation/experiment results. To assess the feasibility of the experiments,
        however, we expect some preliminary results in small-scale experiments.
        These drafts will be reviewed by the workshop PC, and accepted drafts
        will be made available to all participants.
        These drafts will be presented and discussed in detail at the workshop, in order
        for the authors to receive constructive feedback. For the final journal article,
        the authors are expected to conduct the experiments, evaluation, or study as
        specified in their registered report.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller;"><b>Flow into ACM TOSEM journal</b>.
        All papers accepted in this track will be invited as Stage 1
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem/registered-papers">ACM TOSEM Registered Papers</a>
        where we will maintain an overlapping set of reviewers. After the workshop, in
        <b>Stage 2</b> of the publication process, the authors will conduct their full
        experiments and submit their extended and updated papers. The reviewing in Stage 2
        will be also accompanied by an <b>artifact evaluation</b>. More details about the
        benefits of this process can be found in this blog post co-authored by the workshop
        organizers:
        <a href="http://fuzzbench.com/blog/2021/04/22/special-issue/">
            http://fuzzbench.com/blog/2021/04/22/special-issue/
        </a>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">
        Depending on the authors' preference, accepted registered report drafts will be
        published in the workshop proceedings of ISSTA'25.
    </p>


    <h3 id="nuggets"><em>Fuzzing Nuggets</em> - Short Papers Track</h3>

    <p>
        The workshop also solicits self-contained short papers of not more than 8 pages,
        excluding references. This track is intended for evidence-backed position papers
        on fuzzing research, or experience reports on state-of-the-art fuzzing practices.
        The goal of this track is to serve as a platform for researchers and practitioners
        to share substantiated opinions or reflections that would be of interest to the
        larger fuzzing community, but which would not ordinarily be appropriate for a
        full-length research paper. Papers will be evaluated by the workshop PC for
        novelty, significance, and soundness of insights as well as clarity of presentation.
        This track is NOT intended for publishing new research ideas that haven't been
        fully empirically evaluated; the registered reports already serve that purpose.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">
        All papers accepted to the short papers track will be published in the workshop
        proceedings, and authors will be invited to give a lightning talk at the workshop.

    <h2 id="faq">Preregistration FAQ</h2>
    <p><b>Q: Accepting papes without considering the outcome of the experiments
        sounds like "lowering the bar" for publication. Won't this lead to 
        low-quality papers?</b><br/>
        A: No. In fact, we strongly believe that the process will lead to higher
        quality papers with a stronger focus on the significance/novelty of the
        proposed approach and the soundness and reproducibility of the evaluation.
        Specifically, moving the in-principle acceptance to a time *before* the
        evaluation is conducted i) improves the soundness of the evaluation
        (based on early reviewer feedback) and ii) ensures that the evaluation
        is free of bias (e.g., HARKing).
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: Does this mean that you can publish negative results too? What is the
        point of that?</b><br/>
        A: Yes. Compared to the existing publication model, our preregistration-based
        model will also allow the publication of negative results, i.e., results that
        show that a proposed approach does indeed not work or a reasonable hypothesis
        does not hold. However, given that reviewers deemed the investigation to be
        worthwhile and the evaluation methodology to be sound, we are convinced that
        the publication even of negative results will not only avoid redundant efforts
        across the community but also enrich our understanding of the problem under
        investigation. Like for positive results, we ask that authors thoroughly
        analyze the underlying reasons for negative results and provide an
        interpretation.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: Can I modify the idea or the experimental protocol after in-principle
        acceptance in Stage-1? If yes, how much can be changed?</b><br/>
        A: Yes. The registered report serves as an agreement on the minimal experiment
        and any deviation must be clearly justified. You are allowed to change the
        paper and the experimental protocol within reason. For instance, if the
        results point to an optimization opportunity for a proposed technique, you
        are welcome to implement and evaluate the benefit of the optimization. If
        the results call for a deeper investigation of certain aspects of the proposal,
        you are welcome to add further research questions. Any such deviation from the
        experimental protocol must be explained in a Summary of Changes which will be
        subject to review in Stage-2. For larger deviations from the evaluation
        protocol or when in doubt, you are welcome to request permission to follow an
        alternative evaluation protocol.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: What if my idea gets "scooped" after my registered report is
        published?</b><br/>
        A: The registered report is published and "active", i.e., the community knows
        that you are working on the project laid out in the registered report. The
        "scoop" would be pretty obvious. Even if related work is published after the
        in-principle acceptance is granted in Stage-1, this will not influence the
        final acceptance decision for your paper in Stage-2. The accepted registered
        report is a joint commitment by the authors and the reviewers.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: What if I cannot finish the experiments and finalize the paper before
        the final submission deadline?</b><br/>
        A: There is indeed a deadline for submitting the final version of your paper.
        If you need an extension, please provide an explanation for this extension
        anda suggestion for a new deadline. Extensions are normally granted but
        require a reasonable justification. If a deadline expires without submission,
        the registered report becomes "inactive" and the in-principle acceptance is
        withdrawn. The paper is not considered "under review" anymore and can be
        submitted elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: What if my final paper gets rejected? Can I submit to other venues?
        What if the other venue rejects the paper claiming that the idea has already
        been published in the registered report?</b><br/>
        A: Unless inactive, withdrawn, or rejected/accepted in Stage-2, an accepted
        registered report is considered as a full paper currently "under review" and
        cannot be submitted elsewhere. Once the report is withdrawn, rejected, or
        inactive, you can submit the final paper elsewhere. You can think of the
        registered report as a workshop paper without evidence or only preliminary
        results. Conferences or journals often publish extensions of workshop papers.
        There should be no difficulty submitting the full paper despite the
        publication of the registered report.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: Stage 1 is double-anonymous: Reviewers do not know the authors and vice
        versa. Yet, Stage 2 is single-anonymous: Reviewers know about the authors
        for each submission. How does this influence the final decision?</b><br/>
        A: Stage 2 merely serves as a confirmation that the agreed experimental
        protocol has been followed and that deviations are explained. Since this
        judgment is objective, we believe that the risk of reviewer bias is
        sufficiently low in Stage 2.
