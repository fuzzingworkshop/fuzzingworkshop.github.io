            <b>Abstract</b>: Do you fuzz your own program, or do you fuzz someone
            else's program? The answer to this question has vast consequences on
            your view on fuzzing. Fuzzing someone else's program is the typical
            adverse "security tester" perspective, where you want your fuzzer to
            be as automatic and versatile as possible. Fuzzing your own code,
            however, is more like a traditional tester perspective, where you may
            assume some knowledge about the program and its context, but may also
            want to _exploit_ this knowledge - say, to direct the fuzzer to
            critical locations.<br/>
            <br/>
            
            In this talk, I detail these differences in perspectives and
            assumptions, and highlight their consequences for fuzzer design and
            research. I also highlight cultural differences in the research
            communities, and what happens if you submit a paper to the wrong
            community. I close with an outlook into our newest frameworks, set
            to reconcile these perspectives by giving users unprecedented control
            over fuzzing, yet staying fully automatic if need be.<br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Fuzzing is a highly effective technique that finds security
                vulnerabilities, stability bugs and correctness issues in a fully 
                automated way. Over the last decade, it has rapidly evolved from being 
                an experimental tool used by security teams to becoming a critical 
                component of the software development life cycle and part of NIST’s 
                standards for software verification. This talk will give insights into
                this journey of fuzzing innovation, from a dumb, blackbox testing 
                technique to a smart, generational whitebox one, augmented with 
                effective memory instrumentation. It will also shed light on the recent
                efforts to standardize fuzzer benchmarking and scaling research efforts
                in the community.<br/>

                <b>Bio</b>: Abhishek Arya is a Principal Engineer and head of the 
                Google Open Source Security Team. His team has been a key contributor 
                to various security engineering efforts inside the Open Source Security
                Foundation (OpenSSF). This includes the Fuzzing Tools (Fuzz-Introspector),
                Supply Chain Security Framework (SLSA, Sigstore), Security Risk Measurement
                Platform (Scorecards, AllStar), Vulnerability Management Solution (OSV) and
                Package Analysis project. Prior to this, he was a founding member of the
                Google Chrome Security Team and built OSS-Fuzz, a highly scaled and automated
                fuzzing infrastructure that fuzzes all of Google and Open Source. His team
                also maintains FuzzBench, a free fuzzer benchmarking service that helps the
                community rigorously evaluate fuzzing research and make it easier to adopt.<br/>
