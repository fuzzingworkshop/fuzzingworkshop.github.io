            <b>Abstract</b>:
            Fuzzing currently has two flavors—an existing generic, domain-agnostic, solution such as AFL, or developers often build a custom generator such as “X”-Smith that is more effective for a specialized domain such as C, SQL, and MLIR. However, constructing a custom fuzzer such as “X”-Smith generally requires significant developer or engineering effort, measured in person-months.

            In this talk, I will reflect on my group’s experience of designing custom fuzzers for data-intensive computing and heterogeneous hardware domains. I will discuss how we had to encode domain-specific constraints, custom feedback guidance, custom search strategies, and custom mutation operators to make the fuzzing solutions effective for a specialized domain. Then, reflecting on this manual specialization effort, I will propose a new direction on how we should strive to bootstrap a custom fuzzer, automatically or semi-automatically, without too much manual effort.

            Toward this vision of “bootstrapping a custom fuzzer without paying too much”, I will share several ongoing effort to find the right balance between the universality of a fuzzer and its effectiveness in a specialized domain: (1) custom mutation synthesis from examples, (2) automated grammar refinement to constrain fuzzing, (3) LLM-guided constraint-generation for mutation, and (4) a lightweight DSL for context-guided input generation.

            <b>Bio</b>:
            Miryung Kim is a Professor and a Vice Chair of Graduate Studies in UCLA Computer Science. She directs Software Engineering and Analysis Laboratory. She helped define the new area of Software Engineering for Data Intensive Computing (SE4DA and SE4ML). She works on automated testing and debugging for Apache Spark and developer tools for heterogeneous computing. She conducted the first systematic study of refactoring practices in industry and quantified rearchitecting benefits at Microsoft using Windows version history. She conducted the largest scale study of data scientists in industry. Her group’s Java bytecode debloating JDebloat made a tech transfer impact to Navy.

            She received her BS from KAIST and MS and PhD from University of Washington under the supervision of David Notkin. She was an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin, moved to UCLA as an Associate Professor with tenure in 2014, and was promoted to a Full Professor in 2019. She spent time as a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research. She is an Amazon Scholar at Amazon Web Services.

            She produced 6 professors (Columbia, Purdue, two at Virginia Tech, etc). For her impact on nurturing the next generation of academics, she received the ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award. She is a Program Co-Chair of ESEC/FSE 2022, one of top 2 conferences in SE. She is a Keynote Speaker at ASE 2019 and ISSTA 2022. She gave Distinguished Lectures at CMU, UIUC, UMN, UC Irvine, etc. She is an ACM Distinguished Member.

            <b>Abstract</b>: I too once lived in an ivory tower, pondering the deepest mysteries of the universe (in my occasional snatches of spare time between writing grant proposals and fighting with IRBs). Then I quit and went into industry instead. To my surprise, there was interesting research happening there. I was still able to ponder the mysteries of creation, and I was better paid, and there were no IRBs.
                Is the modern research university a path dependent outcome, or is it what we’d come up with if we were designing from scratch? What are the pros and cons of an endowed chair vs. a sinecure at FAANG? Is being surrounded by credentialed colleagues pursuing the same questions as you less important in the age of the internet, or more? Do crass financial incentives ruin the integrity of the scientific process? Is industry still a place where you can do deep, foundational work?
                As computer scientists, two career paths stretch out in front of us. How can you tell which one you belong on? Come to this talk and find out. You will also learn about the secret third career path for CS theorists, and the even more secret fourth one.

            <b>Bio</b>:
            Will Wilson is a failed mathematician who switched to programming because it seemed easier. He built distributed databases at FoundationDB, Apple, and Google. Along the way, he realized that computers are actually the enemy, and founded Antithesis to put them in their place.
